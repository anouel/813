Women at the Deer Valley Utility Company claim that their job performances are not rewarded to the same degree as the job performances of men. Is there statistical evidence to support this complaint? This summary analysis for the Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity includes findings and a brief discussion of other factors we may want to investigate before issuing a final report.

We have the following data for 60 people:

`Salary`: thousands of dollars.

`Gender`: "1" for men and "0" for women.

`Rating`: The employee's average performance rating over the last two years. The scale has a top score of 100. The company claims that performance rating is the primary factor in the determination of salary.

`Credits` earned either in college courses or company programs.

Retrieve data from *Stata* and load them into **R**.
<!-- Stata chunk to make data -->
<!-- Replace 1234 with your seed and make eval = TRUE -->
```{stata, eval = FALSE}
net install PS813_EX3, from(https://faculty.polisci.wisc.edu/weimer)
PS813_EX3 1234
save "data/EX3.dta"
```

<!-- R chunk to load data -->
```{r data}
d <- read_dta("data/EX3.dta") %>%
  mutate(Gender = factor(Sex, labels = c("Women","Men")))
```

First, let us plot the raw data. 
```{r summary}
# scatterplot
p <- ggplot(d) + 
  aes(x = Rating, y = Salary, color = Gender) + 
  geom_point(aes(alpha = Credits)) + scale_color_discrete()

# quick y ~ mx linear regression per group
p + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, fullrange = T)
```

# Hypotheses

H1: Job performances of women are rewarded differently than the job performances of men. That is, the relationship between salary and performance differs by gender. 

H0: There is no difference in how men's performance and women's performance are rewarded. That is, the relationship between salary and performance does not differ by gender. 

(There are least two other ways to write this hypothesis and at least one slightly different hypothesis that might better address the question.)

# Model

The dependent variable is salary. For employee $i$, let their salary be $y_i$ in the model $y_i = \beta_0 + ... + \epsilon_i$. $\beta_0$ is the predicted salary, $\hat{y}$, when all other variables in the model are 0.

\color{red}
Note: The model, $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Gender + \beta_2*Rating + \epsilon_i$, does *not* test the relationship of interest. 
```{r gender_rating_model, fig.height = 1}
m1 <- lm(Salary ~ Gender + Rating, data = d) %>% 
  tidy(conf.int = TRUE) 

ggplot(m1 %>% filter(term != "(Intercept)")) + 
  aes(x = term,
      y = estimate, 
      ymin = conf.low, 
      ymax = conf.high) + 
  geom_pointrange() + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(x="", y="OLS Estimate")
```

Why is this wrong? Let's plot the results against our data!
```{r gender_rating_plot}
b0 <- m1$estimate[1]
b1 <- m1$estimate[2]
b2 <- m1$estimate[3]

p +
  geom_line(aes(color = "Men", 
                y = b0 + b1*1 + b2*Rating) ) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = "Women", 
                y = b0 + b1*0 + b2*Rating) ) + 
  scale_color_discrete() +
  labs(color = "",
       y = "Predicted salary") 
```

What is wrong with this picture? Why does this model fail to test the hypothesis? What did it test?
